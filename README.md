TERRA — Easy user guide

Welcome to TERRA. This short, simple guide explains the main actions you’ll use every day. The app runs entirely in your browser and keeps any files or notes on your computer.

## Quick steps

1. Click + Add Category to make a section (for example, "Site A").
2. Click the category area or drag files into it. Use table files (CSV or Excel) and images (PNG, JPG, SVG).
3. Use + Note to add a short message to a category.
4. Click Customize Report to pick which columns to show and the order.
5. Click Generate PDF Report to download your report.

## Files we accept

- Table files: CSV (.csv) and Excel (.xlsx).
- Images: PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG.

If a table has column names in the first row, the app will use those names.

## Alerts — simple explanation

Alerts help you find rows in your tables that match conditions you care about. For example:

- Find rows where Role includes "nurse".
- Find rows where Expiry Date is within the next 30 days.

You create rules in the Alerts tab. Combine a few rules to narrow results (for example: Role contains "nurse" AND Expiry Date within 30 days).

## Helpful details and tips

- Editing parsed tables: click "Edit" on a parsed file to open the inline table editor. You can hide rows, correct values, and change the file's date settings before generating a report.
- Image recommendations: for best PDF quality, use images between 800–2000 pixels on the long side. Very large images may be resized or compressed automatically.
- Reusing content: items added to the Library are available to attach to any category.
- Local storage: categories, files, images, notes, and your theme are stored in your browser on this computer only. Generated PDFs are downloaded to your device; they are not uploaded anywhere by the app.

## Where your data is stored

Files and notes you add are saved in your browser on this computer only. To remove everything and start fresh, open Settings → Clear saved data.

## Problems and fixes

- File won’t upload: check it is a supported file type and try again.
- Dates look wrong: open the file’s Edit view and change the date setting for that file.
- App behaves oddly: use Settings → Clear saved data and reload the page.

## Need more help?

If you still need help, tell the person who gave you the app what you tried and what failed. Include a short description such as "Uploading a CSV fails" or "Generate PDF button doesn't respond" and the browser name/version if possible.
